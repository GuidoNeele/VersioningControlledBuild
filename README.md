# VersioningControlledBuild
A Visual Studio add-in that automates versioning of .NET Framework and VC++ projects. The add-in is virtually a copy of the excellent add-in by Julijan Sribar (http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5851/Versioning-Controlled-Build). The only thing I did was make it work with Visual Studio 2015 by transforming the add-in to a VSIX package. All credits go to Julijan.

For details on using this add-in I can recommend reading the article on CodeProject http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5851/Versioning-Controlled-Build
